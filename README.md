# Spotify-Data-X-Project

Welcome to my team's Spotify project.  In Final Delilverable.ipynb, you'll find several features of our project.  One feature is the User's Listening Summary. For now, the project analyzes a team member's account, however, if you request your listening data on Spotify, you can analyze your own account. 

Later in the project, you can see our Spotify playlist recommender which takes a song from Spotify, and uses machine learning to find similar songs that one might enjoy. The goal of this projet was to accurately recommend songs based on musical components such as danceability or acousticness.  This differs from Spotify's current recommendation algorithm, which is largely based on popularity rather than musical components.
